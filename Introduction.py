st.markdown('"Moving care closer to home" has become a high-priority goal for many NHS commissioning bodies, in particular for the South East Specialised Commissioning region, with a specific focus on moving cardiac activity away from London and back in to the South East region for all type of referral pathways.')

st.markdown('Bringing care closer to home can reduce travel times for patients, with it being a critical factor in aspects of healthcare delivery, patient satisfaction, health outcomes and more.')

st.markdown('Initial scoping of our project focused on all cardiac activity, but we later honed this specifically towards cardiac valve procedures and the Kent and Medway region.')
